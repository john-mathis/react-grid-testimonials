### What I learned

I am continously sharpening my CSS gris skills and this project was a perfect challenge for doing so!


### Continued development

I also built this project using React.js, which is component based. I had some trouble targeting the cards in the CSS individually, since I  attempted to make the component as reusable as possible. I will continue to work on being able to write more effecient code. 


### Useful resources
